The Norconex JEF API requires that you have Java Standard Edition version 1.5
or higher already installed on your system to work properly.

The API gets distributed with the JEF library itself, along with all API 
dependencies and documentation. You should have:

lib/jef.jar         Norconex JEF API library.
lib/log4j.jar       Apache logging API used by JEF.
lib/mail.jar        Optional Oracle/SUN library to send emails.
lib/activation.jar  Optional Oracle/SUN library to send emails.
doc/*               Norconex JEF API documentation
tools/*             Optional utilities.
README.txt          This file.
CHANGES.txt         A history of all changes to the API over time.

Refer to the Javadoc for help on getting started.
To compile and run the jobs you have created for the framework,
you need to ensure the above libraries are part of your classpath.

JEF API being a library, that’s all there is to know to set it up properly.
The exact settings of the applications you create using the API are yours
to define.
