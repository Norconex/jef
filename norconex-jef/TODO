    Norconex Commons Lang and include
    that lang file either as a dependant library, or part of a JEF Fat Jar.

 ** Make sure to update version of all instances of  @since 1.1.1 to reflect 
    final release version (if different).

To consider maybe one day:
- Have a thead utility method that split a job array in X number of threads
- Support for I18N in descriptions and else.
- In the backing up of Log + Progress, consider optional argument to delete
  logs/jobs older than java.util.Date.
- Use metadata class from Norconex Lang on JobContext?
