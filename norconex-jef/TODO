
To consider maybe one day:
- Have a thread utility method that split a job array in X number of threads
- Support for I18N in descriptions and else.
- In the backing up of Log + Progress, consider optional argument to delete
  logs/jobs older than java.util.Date.
- Use metadata class from Norconex Lang on JobContext?
