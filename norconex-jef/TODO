
- Use Apache Commons Exec wherever appropriate.

- Add dynamic jobs
- Add state jobs (e.g. OK, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- Allow for jobs without expected end value?

To consider maybe one day:
- Have a thread utility method that split a job array in X number of threads
- Support for I18N in descriptions and else.
- In the backing up of Log + Progress, consider optional argument to delete
  logs/jobs older than java.util.Date.
