Getting Started
===============

To make the best use of the JEF API, you have to carefully identify
all tasks that makes up your program execution workflow.  All these tasks
are refered to as "jobs".  Jobs are assembled together to obtain the desired
workflow, refered to as a "Job Suite".    
  
First wrap your existing jobs, or create new ones implementing the 
[IJob](./apidocs/com/norconex/jef/job/IJob.html) interface to accomplish the 
required tasks.  Whenever you have more than one job, assemble/group them 
together using one or a combination of 
[AsyncJobGroup](./apidocs/com/norconex/jef/group/AsyncJobGroup.html) and 
[SyncJobGroup](./apidocs/com/norconex/jef/group/SyncJobGroup.html).
  
Create and configure a 
[IJobSuite](./apidocs/com/norconex/jef/suite/JobSuite.html) with your created
jobs. It is highly recommended you job suite creation logic is implemented using
[IJobSuiteFactory](./apidocs/com/norconex/jef/suite/IJobSuiteFactory.html).
Using this factory is the preferred way to load and initialize your 
job suites by external processes such as *JEF Monitor*.
  
When you are done, you can execute it by calling the "execute" method on 
your JobSuite instance.

Optionally, you can attach listeners to get notified of every 
job-related events.  Listners and other useful classes can be found
in the [JEF API](./apidocs/index.html).


Code Sample
-----------

The creation of a job suite may look like this:

    public class MyJobSuiteFactory implements IJobSuiteFactory {

        public JobSuite createJobSuite() {
            IJob rootJob = new AsyncJobGroup("asyncGroupSample", new IJob[] {
                    new MyJobA(),
                    new SyncJobGroup("syncGroupSample", new IJob[] {
                            new MyJobB(),
                            new MyJobC()
                    }),    
                    new MyJobD(),
                    new MyJobE()),
            });
            JobSuite suite = new JobSuite(rootJob);
            
            // add any listners/handlers to the suite
    
            return suite;
        }
    }

Then to launch the execution of a the job suite:
  
    IJobSuiteFactory factory = new MyJobSuiteFactory();
    JobSuite suite = factory.createJobSuite();
    suite.execute();
