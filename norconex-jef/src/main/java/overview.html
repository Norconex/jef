<p>
This library constitutes the Norconex Java Execution Framework.
</p>
<p>
Simple steps to get started:
<ul>
  <li>Create one or more jobs ({@link com.norconex.jef.IJob}) to accomplish
      the required tasks.</li>
  <li>If you have more than one job, assemble/group them together using one or
      a combination of
      {@link com.norconex.jef.AsyncJobGroup} and
      {@link com.norconex.jef.SyncJobGroup}.</li>
  <li>Create and configure a job suite ({@link com.norconex.jef.suite.JobSuite})
      with your created jobs (it is recommended you use 
      {@link com.norconex.jef.suite.IJobSuiteFactory} for the suite creation
       process).</li>
  <li>Run your job suite by passing it to 
      {@link com.norconex.jef.JobRunner#runSuite(com.norconex.jef.suite.JobSuite)}.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>
The creation of a job suite may look like this:
<pre>
    public class MyJobSuiteFactory implements IJobSuiteFactory {
    
        public JobSuite createJobSuite() {
            IJob rootJob = new AsyncJobGroup("asyncGroupSample", new IJob[] {
                    new MyJobA(),
                    new SyncJobGroup("syncGroupSample", new IJob[] {
                            new MyJobB(),
                            new MyJobC()
                    }),    
                    new MyJobD(),
                    new MyJobE()),
            });
            JobSuite suite = new JobSuite(rootJob);
            
            // add any listners/handlers to the suite

            return suite;
        }
    }
</pre>
</p>

<p>
In the end, launching a job suite may look like this:

<pre>
    IJobSuiteFactory factory = new MyJobSuiteFactory();
    JobSuite suite = factory.createJobSuite();
    JobRunner jobRunner = new JobRunner();
    jobRunner.runSuite(suite);
</pre>

</p>
