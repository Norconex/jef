
ILogManager will have a method called:
  registerJEFLogger(SLF4jLogger rootLogger).
    - with default implementating checking if logback before adding filesystem
      appender.  Maybe support log4j also.
      For other, throw warning that people are on their own.
      - Offer a way to disable too, throwing warning.
 



To consider maybe one day:
- Have dynamic jobs
- Have a thread utility method that split a job array in X number of threads
- Support for I18N in descriptions and else.
- In the backing up of Log + Progress, consider optional argument to delete
  logs/jobs older than java.util.Date.
- Have a way to configure logger created by JEF via logback.xml
  - Challenge: making sure the minimum required are met (like pattern?).
- Have rollback strategy instead of backups?
- Remove mail dependency?
